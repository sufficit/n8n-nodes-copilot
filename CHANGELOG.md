## [3.31.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added

#### ðŸŽ‰ New Node: GitHub Copilot Auth Helper

- **Interactive OAuth Device Flow authentication** via beautiful HTML page
- Generates complete HTML page that handles entire Device Flow
- No terminal/CLI required - everything runs in browser

  - âœ… Displays code in large, copyable format
  - âœ… Auto-opens GitHub authorization page
  - âœ… Automatic polling until authorization complete
  - âœ… Shows token ready to copy when done
  - âœ… Beautiful modern UI with gradient design
  - âœ… Step-by-step visual progress
  - âœ… Mobile responsive
  - âœ… Error handling for all OAuth error cases

### Removed

#### OAuth2 Credentials (Non-functional)

- **Removed GitHubCopilotOAuth2Api credential** - did not work with n8n limitations
- **Removed GitHubCopilotDeviceFlow credential** - requires n8n core modifications
- **Kept only GitHubCopilotApi credential** - works perfectly with manual token input

### Changed

- Simplified credential system to single working credential
- Auth Helper node provides better UX than removed OAuth2 credentials

### How to Use New Auth Helper

1. Add "GitHub Copilot Auth Helper" node to workflow
2. Execute node
3. Copy HTML from output
4. Save as `.html` file and open in browser
5. Follow on-screen instructions
6. Copy token and use in GitHub Copilot OAuth2 credential

### Migration
No migration needed. Existing credentials and nodes continue to work as before.

### Notes
- Auth Helper provides better UX than command-line script
- Device Flow credential prepared but not active (requires n8n core support)
- Script `authenticate.js` still available as alternative
